## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, you don't need any complex setup or build steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sbadillo89/interactive-cv.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd interactive-cv
    ```

3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.

    For the best experience (to avoid potential CORS issues with local files), it's recommended to use a lightweight local server:

    ```bash
    # If you have Node.js installed, you can use the 'serve' package
    npx serve
    ```

    Then, open your browser to the URL provided by the server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
